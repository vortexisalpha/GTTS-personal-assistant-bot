# GTTS-personal-assistant-bot

This is a personal assistant bot using the Google Text To Speech library along with selenium and playsound to allow for voice activated commands (with back and forth dialogue between the machine and user) for example reading emails, signing into school websites or playing songs on youtube. 

My aim was to make a multi-purpose autonumus voice controlled personal assistant and for it not to be limited to one task.
